### Requirements
Python version >= 3.7

PyTorch version >= 1.8.0



### Steps to Run the Framework
This repository contains source code and data samples to run the FL<sub>PM</sub> framework with integrated PM-VLN. We tested and ran the code presented here on a single Tesla GPU with 16GB of RAM.   

### Data Samples
We present in this repository samples from the 3 following datasets:
 - VLN-Touchdown-sample - samples adapted from the Touchdown and StreetLearn datasets.
 - MC-10 - JSON file and 5 sample images of entities.
 - TR-NY-PIT-central - JSON and 5 sample images of path traces.
